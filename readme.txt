################################

Course ascendant block allows controlling from a normal
Moodle course attachement of submodules as metacourses.

The block provides students with a short summary of attached 
sub courses, standing as teaching chapters. The master
course is intended to be the enrolment location, while
attached courses being the static teaching content.

Teachers can control at any time the amount of attached metacourses
by activating them with checkboxes in a course list.

the block allows administrator to choose the top course category
in which modules reside. 

Note that in the delivered version, only an administrator can
add this block to a course or changes settings, as this might
open unded accesses if freely used by unauthorised people.

As accessory option, you may choose to show or not to show surrounding categories
in the course list.
